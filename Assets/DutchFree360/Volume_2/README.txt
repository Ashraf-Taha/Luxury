Dear customer,


Many thanks for your download!


Currently more products are being prepared to be published in the Unity store. 


Extra note:

You find in this free Volume hdr’s with the naming convention ending on _cs.exr & _us.exr

_cs means clipped sun
_us means unclipped sun


The commercial skies also have a extra hdr with naming convention ending on _ns.exr - 

_ns means no sun (so sun is removed from the hdr)

The no sun hdr’s are not included in this free Volume.


The commercial skies can also be found in the Unity asset store.
